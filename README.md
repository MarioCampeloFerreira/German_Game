 <h1 align="center">About me</h1>
 
Hey there! I'm diving into programming and learning Python because I've always been intrigued by it. Turns out, it's not only really enjoyable but also potentially beneficial for my field in Business Management. Mastering coding might even open doors to a developer job someday! I'm loving the journey, having fun, and feeling accomplished when my code (even if simple) works. If you're curious about my progress, check out my project repositories, where I share  projects that help me improve my skills. Got some exciting ideas for future projects too! Can't wait to connect with fellow coding enthusiasts, learn together, and immerse ourselves in this fantastic community! ðŸ˜„

# German Articles Game

This project introduces a game specifically designed to help German language learners of varying proficiency levels master the proper usage of German articles for nouns. I developed the game in response to the limited availability of high-quality applications that focus on this particular learning challenge.

## Gameplay

In the game, players are presented with a German noun and must determine the appropriate article ("Der", "Die", or "Das") to accompany it. Correct answers earn the player a point and a congratulatory message, while incorrect answers provide a feedback message with the correct article. Additionally, the game displays the ratio of correct to wrong answers, allowing users to track their progress and improvement over time. I find this feature particularly motivating, as it helps me recognize my progress and encourages me to continue practicing.

## Dictionary

The game is based on a dictionaries, containing a list of over 3000 most commonly used German nouns and their corresponding articles. The gameplay involves randomly selecting a noun from this list, displaying it to the player, and prompting them to choose the correct article.

## Future Improvements

While the current version of the game is more suitable for intermediate learners due to the absence of translations and rule explanations, I plan to enhance the game in version 2 by adding translations and article rule explanations to better accommodate beginners.

Although this project is still relatively simple, I have many plans for its future improvement and expansion (check the roadmap below). This ongoing process not only benefits the users, but also provides me with an enjoyable experience, allowing me to simultaneously enhance my German language and programming skills.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this game offers a valuable learning tool for German language learners seeking to improve their comprehension and application of German articles for nouns. By enabling users to monitor their progress over time, the game fosters motivation and encourages continued practice. As the project evolves, users can expect even more features and improvements to enhance their learning experience.

## RoadMap

**Version 1** (Day 1, 23rd april 2023)

- **Article Practice**: Players are presented with a German noun and must determine the appropriate article ("Der", "Die", or "Das") to accompany it.
- **Instant Feedback**: Correct answers earn the player a point and a congratulatory message, while incorrect answers provide a feedback message with the correct article.
- **Progress Tracking**: The game displays the ratio of correct to wrong answers, allowing users to track their progress and improvement over time.
- **Extensive Noun List**: The game is based on a dictionary, "german_nouns", containing a list of over 1500 most commonly used German nouns and their corresponding articles.

**Version 2** (Day 2, 24rd april 2023)

- **Display the article rules in the beginning, and a short version every time the user gets the question wrong**  (Done)
- **English, portuguese and swiss Translations** (Done)
- **Include the plural forms** (Done)

**Version 3** (Day 3, 25rd april 2023)

- **Make the questions that are incorrectly answered by the user more likely to be asked** (Done)
- **Allow user to choose between nouns with translations without translations or both** (Done)
- **User-selectable difficulty levels: Implement different difficulty levels by including categories of nouns, such as most common (Current), beginner, intermediate, and advanced.** (At the moment, I have not included this feature, as I am personally only interested on addressing the most common difficulty. However, if you would like me to add this feature (or any other), please let me know and I will be happy to do so!)

this version will be uploaded in next few days as i need to update and extend the dictionary with all the translations

**Future Versions** (if you have any other ideas let me know!)

- **Other games in the same theme, for example, adjective endings**
- **Another Grammar related games in different languages, potentially Japanese**
- **Develop an Android App**
